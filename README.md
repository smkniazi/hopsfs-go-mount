What is hopsfs-mount
====================

Allows to mount remote HopsFS as a local Linux filesystem and allow arbitrary applications / shell scripts to access HopsFS as normal files and directories in efficient and secure way.

Usage 
-----

```
Usage of ./hopsfs-mount:
  ./hopsfs-mount [Options] Namenode:Port MountPoint

  -allowedPrefixes string
        Comma-separated list of allowed path prefixes on the remote file system, if specified the mount point will expose access to those prefixes only (default "*")
  -clientCertificate string
        Client certificate location (default "/srv/hops/super_crypto/hdfs/hdfs_certificate_bundle.pem")
  -clientKey string
        Client key location (default "/srv/hops/super_crypto/hdfs/hdfs_priv.pem")
  -fuse.debug
        log FUSE processing details
  -getGroupFromPath
    	Get the group from path. This will work if a hopsworks project is mounted
  -hadoopUserName string
    	Hadoop username        
  -lazy
        Allows to mount HopsFS filesystem before HopsFS is available
  -logFile string
        Log file path. By default the log is written to console
  -logLevel string

        Enables mount with readonly
  -retryMaxAttempts int
        Maxumum retry attempts for failed operations (default 10)
  -retryMaxDelay duration
        maximum delay between retries (default 1m0s)
  -retryMinDelay duration
        minimum delay between retries (note, first retry always happens immediatelly) (default 1s)
  -retryTimeLimit duration
        time limit for all retry attempts for failed operations (default 5m0s)
  -rootCABundle string

Other Platforms
---------------
It should be relatively easy to enable this working on MacOS and FreeBSD, since all underlying dependencies are MacOS and FreeBSD-ready. Very few changes are needed to the code to get it working on those platforms, but it is currently not a priority for authors. Contact authors if you want to help.
